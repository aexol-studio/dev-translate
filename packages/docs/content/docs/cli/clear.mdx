# clear

Clear the translation cache for your account.

## Usage

```bash
dev-translate clear
```

## Purpose

Use this command when you need to:

- Force re-translation of all content
- Fix incorrect cached translations
- Start fresh after significant source changes

## Output

```bash
$ dev-translate clear

Clearing translation cache...
✓ Cache cleared successfully

Next translation will process all files as new.
```

## How Caching Works

dev-translate caches translations server-side based on:

- Source text content
- Source language
- Target language
- Translation options (formality, context, etc.)

When you translate the same text again, it returns the cached result for free.

## When to Clear Cache

### Changed Context

If you update the context in your configuration:

```json title=".dev-translate.json"
{
  "context": "Medical application (was: E-commerce)"
}
```

Clear the cache to get translations with the new context:

```bash
dev-translate clear
dev-translate translate
```

### Changed Formality

If you change the formality level:

```json title=".dev-translate.json"
{
  "formality": "more" // was: "default"
}
```

### Incorrect Translations

If you notice incorrect translations and want fresh ones:

```bash
dev-translate clear
dev-translate translate
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Clearing the cache means your next translation will be charged for all content, not just changes.
</Callout>

## Selective Re-translation

Instead of clearing the entire cache, you can force re-translation of specific files by:

1. Modifying the source file (add a space, then remove it)
2. Deleting the target language files
3. Running translate again

This is more cost-effective than clearing the entire cache.

## API Reference

The clear command calls the GraphQL API:

```graphql
mutation {
  api {
    clearCache
  }
}
```

This clears all cached translations associated with your API key.
