description: Predict token consumption before translation

# predict

Predict the token consumption for translating your locale files without actually performing the translation.

## Usage

```bash
dev-translate predict
```

## Purpose

Use this command to:

- Estimate costs before translating
- Check what will be translated
- Identify cached vs. new translations

## Output

```bash
$ dev-translate predict

Predicting translation costs...

common.json:
  Total tokens: 500
  Cached: 200 (40%)
  New: 300 (60%)

errors.json:
  Total tokens: 150
  Cached: 150 (100%)
  New: 0 (0%)

─────────────────────────
Total:
  Tokens to translate: 300
  Cached tokens: 350
  Estimated cost: $0.015
```

## How It Works

1. Reads your configuration from `.dev-translate.json`
2. Scans all JSON files in the source language folder
3. Sends content to the prediction API
4. Returns token counts and cache status

## Cached Translations

dev-translate caches translations server-side. The predict command shows:

- **Total tokens**: All tokens in your source files
- **Cached**: Tokens that won't be re-translated (already in cache)
- **New**: Tokens that will be translated and charged

<Callout type="info">Cached translations are free. Only new translations consume tokens.</Callout>

## Use Cases

### Before Large Updates

```bash
# Check costs before translating
dev-translate predict

# If acceptable, proceed
dev-translate translate
```

### Budget Planning

```bash
# Run weekly to track translation growth
dev-translate predict >> translation-costs.log
```

### CI/CD Cost Alerts

```yaml title=".github/workflows/translate.yml"
- name: Check translation costs
  run: |
    COST=$(dev-translate predict | grep "Estimated cost" | awk '{print $3}')
    if (( $(echo "$COST > 10.00" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "Warning: Translation cost exceeds $10"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Forcing Fresh Predictions

To get a prediction ignoring the cache:

```json title=".dev-translate.json"
{
  "omitCache": true
}
```

This shows the full cost as if nothing was cached.
